**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Eda!**

I am Eda Ã‡elikeloÄŸlu, a data enthusiast who is developing expertise in data science and machine learning. I graduated as a data science specialist from the Istanbul Kodluyor project. I work with Python programming language and have gained experience in data visualization, data analysis, and creating interactive data applications using Streamlit.


**My Technical Skills**

- **Data Science and Machine Learning**: Proficient in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Python**: Developing data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning projects using Python.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations with libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Streamlit**: Presenting my data analyses and models as interactive web applications using Streamlit.

**Continuing to Learn**

- **Deep Learning**: Learning deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Big Data**: Exploring big data technologies such as Apache Spark and Hadoop.
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Developing skills in natural language processing (NLP).

**My Goals**

- To work on more machine learning and deep learning projects to enhance my knowledge and experience.
- To participate in data science communities to share knowledge and gain experience through new projects.
- To contribute to open source projects and support the community.
